# Manual Regression Test Suite

Reusable manual test plan for the Telegram Bridge MCP server. Run through these scenarios after any significant change to verify core functionality.

**Notation:**

- **[Agent]** = agent calls MCP tool
- **[Op]** = operator action on Telegram
- **[Verify]** = expected outcome to confirm

## Prerequisites

1. `pnpm build` — clean
2. `pnpm lint` — clean
3. `pnpm test` — all passing
4. Restart the MCP server (`shutdown` → call any tool to restart)
5. `session_start` — fresh session (SID 1)
6. `set_topic` with a test label (e.g. "🧪 Test")

### A7. Message Inspection

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A7.1 | [Agent] `send_text` → `get_message(msg_id)` | Returns content, timestamp, sid, versions |
| A7.2 | [Agent] `get_chat` → [Op] presses Allow | Returns chat id, type, title, description |

### A8. Diagnostics

| Step | Action | Expected |

| A8.2 | [Agent] `dump_session_record` | Returns file with full event timeline |

### A9. Reply-To and Callback Routing

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A9.1 | [Agent] `send_text` → [Op] replies to it → [Agent] `dequeue_update` | Reply received with `reply_to` field, `routing: "targeted"` |

## Part B — Multi-Session Tests

> Requires 2+ MCP clients connected simultaneously.
> See `docs/multi-session-test-script.md` for the full multi-session test plan.

### B1. Session Lifecycle

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1.1 | [S1] already connected → [S2] `session_start(name: "Scout")` | S2 gets SID 2, `sessions_active: 2`, `fellow_sessions` lists S1 |
| B1.2 | [S2] `list_sessions` | Both sessions listed with SIDs and names |
| B1.3 | [S2] `close_session` → [S2] `session_start(name: "Scout")` | Fresh SID, clean rejoin |

### B2. Targeted Routing

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B2.1 | [S1] `send_text("I'm S1")` → [Op] replies | Only S1 receives reply (`routing: "targeted"`) |

### B3. Governor Routing

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B3.1 | [Op] Sends plain message (not a reply) | Only governor (S1, lowest SID) receives it |
| B3.2 | [S1] `route_message(msg_id, target_sid: 2)` | S2 receives the message |
| B3.3 | [S1] `close_session` → [Op] sends plain message | S2 (now governor) receives it |

### B4. DM Permissions

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B4.1 | DM auto-granted on session approval | S1↔S2 bidirectional after S2 approved |
| B4.2 | [S2] `send_direct_message(target_sid: 1, text)` | S1 receives `direct_message` event |
| B4.3 | [S2] `close_session` | DM permissions for S2 revoked |

### B5. Health Check

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B5.1 | Governor stops polling for >6 minutes | Operator gets 3-option prompt (reroute/promote/wait) |
| B5.2 | Governor resumes polling | "Session is back online" notification |

---

## Known Issues

- **`get_chat` timeout**: The 60-second approval prompt may time out before the operator can respond. The `pollButtonPress` mechanism may have a race condition with session-queue routing. Tracked for investigation.
