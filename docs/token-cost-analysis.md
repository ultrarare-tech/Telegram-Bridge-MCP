# Token Cost Analysis — Telegram Bridge MCP

> **Purpose:** An honest study of how using this MCP affects the token consumption of an AI agent, what patterns are cheap, what patterns are expensive, and what decisions were made as a result.

---

## Background

Every tool call an agent makes has a token cost composed of three parts:

1. **Tool schema overhead** — the tool's name, description, and parameter definitions are injected into the context on every turn. This is a fixed per-session cost.
2. **Tool call arguments** — the text the agent writes when invoking the tool (e.g. the message body, parameters).
3. **Tool result** — the response returned to the agent and inserted into the context.

All three accumulate in the context window and are re-submitted to the model on each subsequent turn. This means token costs are **cumulative**, not per-call.

---

## 1. Schema Overhead (Fixed Cost per Session)

Every registered MCP tool contributes its full name + description + parameter schema to the system prompt on every inference call. This cost is constant regardless of how many tools are actually invoked.

### Measurement (v1.12.0, 35 tools)

> **Note:** These measurements are from V2. V3 reduces tool count from 35 to 34 (consolidating polling and media tools while adding new message primitives and session tooling). The structure of the cost analysis remains valid; absolute numbers are slightly lower.

A rough token count of all tool definitions in this MCP:

| Category | Tools | Approx. tokens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Messaging (send_text, notify, ask, choose, etc.) | 10 | ~2,000 |
| Polling (dequeue_update) | 1 | ~300 |
| Media (send_file) | 1 | ~400 |
| Interaction (confirmation, buttons, reaction, etc.) | 7 | ~1,050 |
| Status / utility (send_new_checklist, show_typing, etc.) | 6 | ~600 |
| Admin / misc (restart, agent guide, get_me, etc.) | 4 | ~350 |
| **Total** | **35** | **~5,900 tokens** |

**~5,900 tokens** are added to every context window purely from tool definitions, before the agent does anything. On a model charging $3/M tokens (input), this is ~$0.02 per session — negligible for a long session, significant if sessions are very short.

### What this means

If you only need a subset of tools for a given agent, a stripped-down configuration with fewer registered tools meaningfully reduces per-call overhead. For power users with long sessions, the full schema amortizes well.

---

## 2. Tool Call Argument Cost (Variable)

When the agent invokes a tool, it writes the arguments as tokens. For text-sending tools, the dominant cost is the **message body** itself — the same text the agent would write in a direct response.

### Key insight: arguments ≈ the message itself

```ts
send_text(text="Here is my answer to your question...") 
```

The token count of the `text` argument is essentially the same as if the agent had responded directly. There is a small fixed overhead per call (~10–20 tokens for the JSON wrapper and tool name), but it is negligible.

**Net overhead of a single `send_text` call over a direct LLM response: ~1–2%.**

---

## 3. Tool Result Cost (Variable)

The tool result is injected back into the context. Results vary widely:

| Tool | Typical result size | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `send_text` | ~50 tokens | `{ ok: true, message_id: 123, ... }` |
| `notify` | ~50 tokens | Same |
| `dequeue_update` | ~100–400 tokens | Compact event format + pending count |
| `send_file` | ~80 tokens | File ID + metadata |
| `ask` / `choose` | ~100–300 tokens | Includes user's reply |

Results also accumulate in context. In a long session with 50 tool calls, the results alone can add **5,000–15,000 tokens** to the context, which are re-submitted on every subsequent turn.

---

## 4. The Streaming Problem — Why We Don't Auto-Stream

### The O(N²) explosion

`sendMessageDraft` requires the **full accumulated text** on every call — there is no delta/append mode. If an agent simulates token-by-token streaming by calling the tool on each token:

$$\text{total argument tokens} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} i = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$$

For a 500-token response:

| Approach | Tokens consumed |
| --- | --- |
| `send_text` (one call) | ~520 tokens |
| 10-step milestone drafts | ~5,200 tokens (10×) |
| 50-step fine drafts | ~13,000 tokens (25×) |
| Token-by-token (500 calls) | ~125,250 tokens (241×) |

Token-by-token streaming is **241× more expensive** than a single `send_text`. It would cost ~$0.38 on a $3/M token model just for one streamed response.

### What we actually built

V3 replaces `send_message_draft` with two tools:

- **`show_animation`** — server-managed visual placeholder that auto-juggles as the agent sends real messages. No O(N²) cost.
- **`append_text`** — delta-append to an existing message. Server-side concatenation means the agent sends only the new chunk, not the full accumulated text.

This eliminates the O(N²) problem entirely for streaming use cases. `append_text` is O(N) total — each call sends only the delta.

For milestone-style progress updates, `show_animation` handles the lifecycle automatically. The agent calls `show_animation()` at the start, sends messages normally, and calls `cancel_animation()` when done.

**Verdict:** Automatic typewriter streaming is still not offered, but `append_text` makes deliberate progressive message building affordable.

## 5. Context Accumulation in Long Sessions

In a typical loop session (wait → respond → wait → respond…), the context window grows continuously:

```text
Turn 1:  schema(6,600) + system(~500) + user_msg(200) + tool_call(300) + tool_result(100)
Turn 2:  turn_1(7,700) + user_msg(200) + tool_call(300) + tool_result(100)
Turn 3:  turn_2(8,300) + user_msg(200) + tool_call(300) + tool_result(100)
...
Turn N:  (~7,700 + (N-1) × 900) tokens
```

After 50 turns, the context is ~**52,000 tokens** even for simple short messages. This is an inherent property of stateful LLM sessions, not specific to this MCP.

### Mitigation patterns

- **Summarize aggressively** between major task boundaries. A 50-turn context can often be summarized into ~500 tokens.
- **Use `dequeue_update`** for all polling — it returns one update at a time in compact format with a `pending` count, keeping result payloads small.
- **Prefer `notify` over `send_text` for status updates** — same token cost but semantically clearer, reducing the chance the agent re-reads it as content requiring a response.
- **Don't log intermediate tool results you won't use** — if you call `show_typing`, its `true` result doesn't need to be referenced again. It still sits in context though.

## 6. Cost Comparison: MCP vs Direct API

For a developer considering whether to use this MCP vs writing a bot directly:

| Aspect | Direct bot code | Telegram Bridge MCP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool schema overhead | 0 | ~6,600 tokens/session |
| Per-message call overhead | 0 | ~20 tokens |
| Context growth per turn | N/A | ~900 tokens/turn |
| Agent capability | Code only | Any MCP-capable model |
| Latency per tool call | N/A | ~1–2 RTTs (stdio + HTTPS) |

The MCP overhead is real but modest for sessions longer than a few turns. The break-even point vs a custom-coded bot is essentially "turn 1" — the MCP enables capabilities (interactive confirmation, voice transcription, dynamic choice menus) that would require significant coding otherwise.

---

## 7. Recommendations for Cost-Conscious Use

1. **One outbound tool call per agent turn.** Don’t chain `show_typing` → `send_text` → `set_reaction` unless each is genuinely needed. Each call adds ~100–200 tokens to the permanent context.

2. **Use `confirm` / `choose` instead of `ask`** when the answer space is known. Button responses are shorter than typed text, reducing the result payload.

3. **Use `dequeue_update` instead of deprecated polling tools.** V3 consolidates all polling into one tool with compact output format. The `pending` count lets the agent decide whether to dequeue again without wasting tokens.

4. **Use `append_text` instead of full re-sends for progressive messages.** Each call sends only the new delta — O(N) total vs O(N²) for full-text re-sends. Use it when the UX benefit clearly justifies it (e.g. a long-running research task where the user would otherwise see nothing for minutes).

5. **Restart sessions for unrelated tasks.** Tool results from a previous task sit in context forever. A fresh session for an unrelated task starts with only the schema overhead instead of carrying 40,000 tokens of prior conversation.

## 8. Estimated Session Costs

Representative costs at $3/M input + $15/M output (approximating Claude Sonnet pricing as of early 2026):

| Session type | Turns | Approx. tokens | Approx. cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Short Q&A (5 turns) | 5 | ~12,000 | ~$0.04 |
| Medium task (20 turns) | 20 | ~26,000 | ~$0.09 |
| Long session (50 turns) | 50 | ~52,000 | ~$0.18 |
| Long session + streaming (50 turns, 10 drafts/msg) | 50 | ~250,000 | ~$0.88 |

The streaming case demonstrates why the automatic typewriter wrapper was rejected. At 10 milestone drafts per message it adds 5× cost to a long session — and that's a conservative estimate.
