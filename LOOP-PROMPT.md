# Telegram Loop Prompt

Start a persistent Telegram chat loop using the Telegram Bridge MCP tools.

## Channel Rule

Once the loop is active, Telegram is the conversational surface.
Do not answer substantive operator messages in the VS Code chat panel.
Use VS Code only for tool execution and hidden coordination.
Return to VS Code chat only if the operator explicitly exits the loop or Telegram tools are unavailable.

## Setup

1. Call `get_agent_guide`
2. Read `telegram-bridge-mcp://communication-guide`
3. Call `get_me` — if it fails, report the error to the user and stop
4. `session_start` — intro + handles pending messages from previous session
5. `dequeue_update` — enter the loop

## Loop

→ receive
→ react (if appropriate)
→ `show_animation` (contextual:thinking)
→ think
→ `show_animation` (contextual:working)
→ work
→ `show_typing` (will cancel animation unless set to persistent)
→ reply/interact
→ `dequeue_update`

## Canonical Recipe

```text
1. dequeue_update(timeout: 300)
2. update arrives → handle it, reply in Telegram
3. timed_out → call dequeue_update again (stay in loop)
4. error → report in Telegram, then call dequeue_update again
```

Do not restart, shut down, re-bootstrap, or re-announce the session just because the operator says "resume the loop" or "stay in the loop." That means: call `dequeue_update` again.

## Instruction Precedence

When rules conflict, follow this order:

1. Active operator instruction
2. Loop-mode Telegram communication rules (this file + `telegram-communication.instructions.md`)
3. Role prompt (Overseer / Worker / custom)
4. General coding-agent defaults
5. Memory notes — advisory only, not authoritative

If memory conflicts with live tool state or current operator instruction, memory loses.

## Visible Presence

Use `show_animation` as the default "I am thinking / working" signal.
Use `send_new_progress` only when you intend to update the same progress message over time.
Use `send_new_checklist` only for real multi-step tracked workflows.
Do not create progress or checklist artifacts for one-shot status signaling.

## Common Failure Modes

- Replying in VS Code chat while the loop is active
- Restarting/recovering the session when a simple `dequeue_update` call would suffice
- Trusting stale memory over live tool state (stored SID/PIN, old test counts, outdated board state)
- Using progress/checklist tools for presence instead of `show_animation`
- Deleting or mass-editing user-visible messages without explicit approval
